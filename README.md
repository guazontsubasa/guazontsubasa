- 👋 Hi, I’m @guazontsubasa

- 💻 I'm currently using PHP, Laravel, SlimPHP, Containers, Micro-services, Javascript, Tailwindcss, SvelteJs, Vite, HTMX, Alpinejs, NodeJs.
- 💞️ Happiness is doing what we like every day.
- 🪃 I like programming, I like helping others, I like learning and improving myself. I like listening to and reading others. You always learn something.

I'm from Ushuaia, "End of the world, beginning of everything."
I studied Systems Analyst at UNLP, while studying PHP on my own. I created some websites along the way to learn, and since then I haven't stopped learning. What is not used is lost, so I always try to use what I have learned and continue improving myself at a professional level.

Currently living in La Plata, BsAs, Argentina
